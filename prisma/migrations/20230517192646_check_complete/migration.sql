  Warnings:

  - The required column `id` was added to the `Employee` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
  - Added the required column `updatedAt` to the `Employee` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
